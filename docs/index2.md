# Cryptography Primer

<div class="welcome">

<p>This is your go-to place to learn about cryptography and make educated and secure decisions.</p>

<ul class="welcome">
<li>Learn about foundational cryptographic algorithms</li>
<li>Understand how and where an algorithm can be applied and what constraints exist</li>
<li>Choose the right algorithm, mode and parameters</li>
</ul>

<p>The Cryptography Primer is designed to be <i>easily understandable without deep mathematical knowledge</i>. In fact, we don't include information about the mathematical foundations of the algorithms, but provide information about the real-world consequences of the underlying math instead.</p>
