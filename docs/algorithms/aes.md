# AES (Advanced Encryption Standard)

!!! success "This algorithm is recommended"

    AES is considered __secure__. Use AES with 128, 192 or 256 (pick the largest size feasible for your system) with GCM mode of operation.
    GCM provides authentication, which makes this an AEAD cipher.

On this page you will learn:

* What is AES, and features does it provide?
* How secure is AES?
* What can I use instead of AES?
* What modes of operation can I use with AES?
* Where and how is AES being used?

## AES in Practice

AES comes in multiple forms: AES 128, AES 192, AES 256. The number specifies the size of the private key that is being used. The higher the number, the higher the security (but also the slower the encryption and decryption speed). Even the smallest 128 Bit (16 Bytes) key size is still considered secure, so it is considered safe to use. When your system and environment allows it, you can feel free to use 192 Bit (24 Bytes) or 256 Bit (32 Bytes) to even enhance the security.

## How to use passwords to encrypt/decrypt with AES

Usually you use AES in a manner that the key is derived from the password that a user has to enter to encrypt/decrypt the data. Because the key is of fixed length (either 128, 192 or 256 Bits - which are 16, 24 or 32 Bytes, respectively), you can not use the password as the key directly, because that would impose insecure and inpractical constraints on the password that the user has to choose.

Instead, a key derivation function is used to create an AES-compatible key from a password. [PBKDF2](algorithms/pbkdf2.md) (Password Based Key Derivation Function 2) is a state of the art key derivation function.

## Modes of operation

!!! hint inline end 

    The key sizes 192 and 256 do not change the block size. The block size is always 128 Bits, even when larger keys are being used.

AES is a block-cipher, which means that it can only encrypt data with the exact block size of 128 Bits (16 Bytes). This means that it must be combined with a so-called "Mode of operation" in order to be able to encrypt arbitrary number of bytes. 

There are modes that add authentication to the encryption output, so that Authenticated Encryption with Associated Data (AEAD) is made possible, and there are modes that do not include authentication. It is recommended to use one of the modes with authentication, because it does not have notable negative performance or memory impacts, but strengthens security.

## Modes with Authentication (AEAD)

|Mode of Operation|Full Name|Description|
|------|---------|-----------|
|GCM|Galois/Counter Mode|<div class="admonition success"><p class="admonition-title">This mode is recommended</p><p>The GCM mode uses a random initialization vector (IV) for better security. This means that the same encrypted plaintext does never result in the same ciphertext. The recommended lenght of the initialization vector is [96 Bit](https://csrc.nist.gov/publications/detail/sp/800-38d/final) (12 Bytes).</p></div>|
|CCM|Counter with CBC-MAC|<div class="admonition info"><p class="admonition-title">Considered secure</p><p>This mode is considered secure and you can safely use it. It is somewhat slower than GCM, though.</p></div>|
|EAX|<i>unknown</i>|<div class="admonition info"><p class="admonition-title">Not widely used</p><p>This mode is not widely used and hence not widely studied, so it is unsure how secure it is. While it is rather easy to implement, it is also slower than other modes.</p></div>|
|OCB|Offset Codebook Mode|<div class="admonition info"><p class="admonition-title">This mode is patented</p><p>The OCB mode is very, very fast and considered secure. However, it is patented in the U.S. It is free to use in open source software. If you want to use it in a commercial product, you would need to require a <a href="https://www.cs.ucdavis.edu/~rogaway/ocb/license.htm">license or permission to use</a>.</p></div>|

??? info "What is the difference between an IV (initialization vector) and a nonce?"

    Secure modes use either an "IV" (initialization vector) or a nonce. But what is the difference?

    *Initialization Vector*

    The IV needs to be random (generated with a random number generator suitable for cryptography, as you can find in your crypto library).
    __You must generate a new IV for each encrypted message.__

    *Nonce*

    "Nonce" means "Number only used once". While this is true for an IV, a nonce does not have the requirement to be random. You can safely
    use a steadily increasing number (a counter) as your nonce - __as long as you don't re-use the same nonce for the same key multiple times__.

## Modes without Authentication

!!! warning

    You should only use modes without authentication when you have reasons to not use a mode with authentication (listed above).

|Mode of Operation|Full Name|Description|
|------|---------|-----------|
|CBC|Cipher Block Chaining|<div class="admonition info"><p class="admonition-title">Recommended, when GCM can not be used (see above)</p><p>This method improves over ECB as it "mixes" each previous block into the currently encrypted block, which hides patterns and does not encrypt the same block into the same ciphertext. It is always used with an Initialization Vector (IV) in order to even strengthen security and make it possible that even the same plaintext does not yield the same ciphertext.</p></div>|
|CFB|Cipher Feedback|This mode is pretty similar to CBC, but chains the blocks in a different way. It is also always used with an Initialization Vector.|
|CTS|Ciphertext Stealing|Ciphertext stealing is a variation of ECB or CBC, but is in practice only used like CBC. The only difference is that the last two blocks are chained differently - up until this the result is the same as CBC.|
|OFB|Output Feed*b*ack|...|
|ECB|Electronic Code Book|<div class="admonition failure"><p class="admonition-title">Not recommended<p><p>This method is *not recommended*, because it does not introduce diffusion into the ciphertext, which means that the same block is encrypted to the same ciphertext, effectively leaking patterns, which can easily be used to gain information that should be hidden.</p></div>|

### AES encryption and decryption

Here's a code sample on a simple use case to encrypt and decrypt data:

=== "Python"

    !!! info

        This code sample requires the widely used [`pyca/cryptography`](https://pypi.org/project/cryptography/) package.

        Install it with `pip install cryptography` or your favorite package manager.

    ``` py
    import os
    from cryptography.hazmat.primitives.ciphers.aead import AESGCM

    # The text to be encrypted:
    plaintext = b"I am secret"

    # Can be None, when no associated data is required:
    authenticated_text= b"authenticated but unencrypted data"

    # Generate a random private key for this example:
    key = AESGCM.generate_key(bit_length=256)

    # Create an object that can encrypt/decrypt with the following cipher:
    # Algorithm: AES
    # Key Size: 256
    # Mode of Operation: GCM - an authenticated mode (see "AEAD")
    aesgcm = AESGCM(key)

    # Generate a "nonce" for this encryption session of size 96 Bits (12 Bytes).
    # This ensures that the same plaintext is not encrypted to the same ciphertext.
    # This strengthens security:
    nonce = os.urandom(12)
    # Notice: NEVER use the same nonce with the same key.

    # Encrypt the data and add the authenticated (but not encrypted) data:
    ciphertext = aesgcm.encrypt(nonce, plaintext, authenticated_text)

    # The content of "ciphertext" can now be shared via an untrusted medium.
    # The receiver also needs to know the "nonce" and the authenticated text (when used).

    # Decrypt the ciphertext back into the plaintext:
    plaintxt = aesgcm.decrypt(nonce, ciphertext, authenticated_text)

    print(plaintext)

    # Result: "I am secret"
