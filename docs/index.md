# Cryptography Primer

!!! success "Stay up to date"

    &#x1f6a7; This site is currently in early development. &#x1f6a7;

    Cryptography Primer aims to be your go-to place for __precise__, __well-researched__ and __easy-to-understand__ info on cryptographic algorithms and systems.

    The author is actively working on fine-tuning existing content and adding new content every day.

    Follow :fontawesome-brands-twitter: [@CryptPrimer](https://twitter.com/CryptPrimer) on Twitter to stay up to date and learn about new content. I'd also love to hear your opinion and feedback!
