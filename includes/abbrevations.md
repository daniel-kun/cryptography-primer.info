*[AES]: Advanced Encryption Standard. A very secure block-cipher that can provide authenticated encryption when combined with the GCM mode of operation.
*[Rijndael]: This is the original name of the algorithm that then became AES - the Advanced Encryption Standard, which is provides state of the art secure encryption.
*[AEAD]: Authenticated Encryption with Associated Data. This describes ciphers that, in addition to confidentiallity, also provide authenticity of the data. This means that you can be sure that the sender of data encrypted using an AEAD cipher is guaranteed to be genuine. AEAD is often added to "normal" ciphers by using an appropriate mode of operation. For example, AES is an AEAD cipher if you use it with the GCM mode.
*[Authenticated Encryption with Associated Data]: "AEAD" for short. This describes ciphers that, in addition to confidentiallity, also provide authenticity of the data. This means that you can be sure that the sender of data encrypted using an AEAD cipher is guaranteed to be genuine. AEAD is often added to "normal" ciphers by using an appropriate mode of operation. For example, AES is an AEAD cipher if you use it with the GCM mode.
*[Block Cipher]: A block cipher is an encryption algorithm that can encrypt exactly one size of data, e.g. 128 Bits. Block ciphers can be used to encrypt arbitrary length of data when they are combined with a "mode of operation". In contrast, Stream Ciphers can directly encrypt arbitrary length of data, even in transit, but are less secure than Block Ciphers.
*[Stream Cipher]: In contrast to a Block Cipher, Stream Ciphers can encrypt arbitrary lengths of data, even in transit. However, they are less secure than Block Ciphers and Block Ciphers can be used together with "modes of operation" to encrpt arbitrary lengths of data, too.
*[symmetric]: Symmetric cryptographic algorithms are mainly used for data encryption. You encrypt a "plaintext" into "ciphertext" using a shared "private key". The disadvantage of this is that the "private key" has to be known by the sender and the receiver and therefore has to be transmitted over a separate, secure channel. There are also asymmetric cryptographic algorithms that allow encryption with a "public key" and digital signatures which do not require the sender/receiver to share the same "private key".

There are also asymmetric cryptographic algorithms that allow encryption with a "public key" and digital signatures which do not require the sender/receiver to share the same "private key".
*[asymmetric]: Asymmetric cryptographic algorithms can be used for encryption and digital signatures. You can encrypt a "plaintext" into "ciphertext" using a "public key" - which can usually be known by anyone - and decrypt it using the "private key". You can also encrypt with the private key and decrypt with the public key. Additionally, you can digitally "sign" a payload using a "private key" and everyone with the corresponding "public key" can verify that the payload was created by the legitimate sender.

*[mode of operation]: In practice, "raw" encryption algorithms such as AES are always used in a "mode of operation", because AES in itself only described how to encrypt/decrypt exactly one block, such as 128 Bit (16 Bytes). The "mode of operation" adds support for arbitrary lengths of data, and some modes even add authentication, which makes the cipher an "AEAD" cipher.

*[key]: A "key" in cryptography can mean different things. Usually, it means the "private key" that is used in symmetric and asymmetric algorithms. In symmetric encryption algorithms (also known as private key algorithms), this same key is used to encrypt and decrypt the "ciphertext" back into "plaintext", which is why it is sometimes only called "key" and not "private key". In asymmetric algorithms (also known as public key algorithms) it is either used to sign a payload or decrypt ciphertext back into plaintext.

*[private key]: The private key is a secret sequence of bytes that is used for encryption. Private keys must only be used by the authorized person/system and must not be known to others. Public keys, in contrast, are free to share widely.
*[public key]: The public key is used in asymmetric encryption and signature algorithms. A public key is mathematically intertwined with exactly one private key. The public key can be shared widely and can be used to validate that data was created by whoever knows the corresponding private key.
*[plaintext]: In cryptography, the "plaintext" is the unencrypted data. This does not have to be actual text, it can be arbitrary bytes in non-readable formats such as MP3, PNG or similar. When plaintext is being encrypted, the encrypted result is called "ciphertext".
*[Plaintext]: In cryptography, the "plaintext" is the unencrypted data. This does not have to be actual text, it can be arbitrary bytes in non-readable formats such as MP3, PNG or similar. When plaintext is being encrypted, the encrypted result is called "ciphertext".
*[ciphertext]: In cryptography, the "ciphertext" is encrypted data. Ciphertext has been created by convertin "plaintext" via an encryption algorithm. Ciphertext can only be converted to "plaintext" if you have the appropriate key.
*[Ciphertext]: In cryptography, the "ciphertext" is encrypted data. Ciphertext has been created by convertin "plaintext" via an encryption algorithm. Ciphertext can only be converted to "plaintext" if you have the appropriate key.
