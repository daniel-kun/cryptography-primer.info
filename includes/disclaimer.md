??? danger "Disclaimer: How to use recommendations from Cryptography Primer"

    The recommendations on Cryptography Primer are based on research on multiple sources that are freely available online, such as:

    - Research papers available on e.g. arxiv.org[^203]
    - Recommendations of Cryptographic Library authors
    - BSI technical guidelines[^200]
    - NIST publications[^201]
    - Blogs of reknown cryptographers or cybersecurity experts
    - crypto.stackexchange.com[^202]
    - security.stackexchange.com[^204]
    - and occasionally other sources
    
    As should always be the case, you should __not take recommendations__ from a single source for granted,
    but instead find at least a second - or better, third - source that confirms this recommendation.

    Also, if you are using recommendations for anything that will be used in a production setting or
    will be used by anyone that relies on it's cryptograhic properties, it is highly recommended to
    let your __concept__ and __implementation__ being reviewed by a reknown cybersecurity firm.

    That being said, the author hopes that Cryptography Primer helps you find the correct algorithm
    to use for your scenario, and find the correct parameters and modes for a safe implementation.
