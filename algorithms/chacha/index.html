The disadvantage of this is that the &quot;private key&quot; has to be known by the sender and the receiver and therefore has to be transmitted over a separate, secure channel. There are also asymmetric cryptographic algorithms that allow encryption with a &quot;public key&quot; and digital signatures which do not require the sender/receiver to share the same &quot;private key&quot;.">Symmetric</abbr> (Private <abbr title="A &quot;key&quot; in cryptography can mean different things.

In asymmetric algorithms (also known as public key algorithms) it is either used to sign a payload or decrypt ciphertext back into plaintext.">Key</abbr>), <abbr title="In contrast to a Block Cipher, Stream Ciphers can encrypt arbitrary lengths of data, even in transit.

<ul class="recommendations">
    <li>Use a CSPRNG (Cryptographically-secure Pseudo Random Number Generator) or HSM (Hardware Security Module), if possible
    <li>Otherwise make sure that you seed your random number generator properly (<b>don't</b> only use the current timestamp)</li>
    <li>Always seed a key generator with new randomness - don't succinctly generate multiples keys from the same random number seed</li>
    <li>Generate keys where they will be ultimately needed and stored - e.g. don't generate keys server-side to use them on the client, but generate them client-side instead.</li>
    <li>Store private keys securely</li>
    <li>Avoid transferring private keys</li>
    <li>It is highly recommended to re-negotiate or rotate keys as often as possible. Don't see a Private Key as something "permanently" bound to a person or a node, but instead make it something ephemeral that can change on a frequent basis.</li>

This means that you can be sure that the sender of data encrypted using an AEAD cipher is guaranteed to be genuine. AEAD is often added to &quot;normal&quot; ciphers by using an appropriate mode of operation. AEAD also allows sending plaintext &quot;associated data&quot; along the ciphertext that can be used by the recipient for additional operations - e.g. to look up the sender's secret key in a database based on an identifier sent with the associated data.
