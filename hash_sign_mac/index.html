<h2 id="what-are-use-cases-for-hashes">What are use-cases for hashes?</h2>
<p>A hash basically "reduces" an arbitrary large message into a fixed size <abbr title="A digest is the result of hashing a message (or arbitrary data for that matter). E.g. when applying a SHA256 hash function on a message, the result is called a &quot;digest&quot;. Digests are also called &quot;hashes&quot; or &quot;hash values&quot;.">digest</abbr> in a non-reversible way. In particular, a hash function aims to do this in a way that possible <em>collisions</em> are as unlikely as possible. Nowadays, when you say "hash function", you usually mean cryptographic hash functions. There are non-cryptographic hash functions<sup id="fnref:1"><a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:1">2</a></sup>, too (but some even refuse to call those hash functions): Most notably CRC<sup id="fnref:2"><a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:2">3</a></sup> (cyclic redundancy check), which is often used to verify that data has not been (unintentionally) corrupted during transport.</p>
<p>But even cryptographic hash functions can be used for non-cryptographic as well as cryptographic use cases:</p>
<h3 id="non-cryptographic-use-cases-for-hash-functions">Non-Cryptographic use-cases for hash functions</h3>
<p>Here are some examples how hash functions are used in non-cryptographic context:</p>
<ul>
<li>Validate that a message has not been corrupted (or modified) during transport. For example, you can often find hashes next to a download link that can be used to validate that the file has exactly the same content as it supposed to have after you have downloaded it.</li>
<li>"Shrink" information to a unique identifier that can be used for lookups. For example, you can look up a whole sentence or even a whole paragraph of text in a database by using it's hash, instead of comparing all characters of the paragraph in the database.</li>

<p>Use-cases for digital signatures:</p>
<ul>
<li>Publish a message and "sign" it so that everyone can verify that it has been written and published by you.</li>
<li>For example, TLS (and therefore HTTPS, which builds on TLS) uses digital signatures to authenticate the server behind the domain that you have requested data from.</li>
<li>The underlying building block for this are x.509 certificates that are also widely used in other systems where it is important to let anybody know that a "certificate", that provides arbitrary permissions or identifications, can be trusted.</li>
<li>Mobile platforms such as Apple's iOS and Google's Android use digital signatures to sign apps in they App Store/Play Store so that the system is able to trust these apps (and in turn is able to block running untrusted apps).</li>
